# React app showing movies.

## Since heroku shut down their free tiers, flask api hosted there is now not working. Search is still working fine but no movies are displayed on categories/home page.

- The app shows movies from OMDb API and my Flask Api. Made to practice React and learn React-Router.

Features:
- Own page for each searched/clicked movie.
- Search for movie function.
- Movies displayed on homepage/all/popular/new come from flask API hosted on Heroku.
